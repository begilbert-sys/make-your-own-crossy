A website for building your own mini crosswords. 
Written in React/TypeScript using the NextJS framework.

The highlight of this program is the crossword generator, which is written in C++ and compiled to WebAssembly using Emscripten. Give it a try! If you'd like to learn more about the algorithm, it has [its own repository](https://github.com/begilbert-sys/Mini-Crossword-Generator/).
